PS3HEN Alternate Installer

Created by lmn7, DeViL303, & xps3riments

Additional firmware support added by PS3Xploit & Coro

PS3HEN 3.3.0 for HFW 4.91 is working now, other versions coming soon.

Currently installing PS3HEN 3.2.2 on OFW 4.80 to 4.82 and HFW 4.83 to 4.90

This was originally hosted directly on the official PS3Xploit site. It is currently linked to from the site, but it is not hosted there now.

I can not test all firmware versions by myself. If you find any problems, contact me on GitHub or psx-place.com (@Coro) so I can fix it.
