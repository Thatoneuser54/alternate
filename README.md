PS3HEN Alternate Installer

Created by lmn7, DeViL303, & xps3riments

Additional firmware support added by PS3Xploit & Coro

Currently installing PS3HEN 3.2.1 on OFW 4.80 to 4.82 and HFW 4.83 to 4.90

This was originally hosted directly on the official PS3Xploit site. It is currently linked to from the site, but it is not hosted there now. For all intents and purposes, this is the current "official" version.

I can not test all firmware versions by myself. If you find any problems, contact me on GitHub, Twitter (@CoroPS3Addict), or psx-place.com (@Coro) so I can fix it.
